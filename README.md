## Welcome

Thank you for visiting my final programming project corresponding to the training cycle as a full stack developer at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/co)

RappiProsperity is a mobile crowfounding application that allows investors to generate additional profits while supporting RappiTenderos to acquire a loan for the purchase of a motorcycle and thus improve their quality of life.
This project was developed under the advice of the [Rappi](https://www.rappi.com.co/) engineering team.

## About

This repository contains the source code of our application, distributed in two branches:

[Fronted branch](https://github.com/cmlesquivel/app-prosperity/tree/frontend-development) where you will find the code corresponding to the visualization of the multiple views of the app, as well as the navigation logic and requests to the backend to obtain the information of each logged in user.

[Backend branch](https://github.com/cmlesquivel/app-prosperity/tree/backend-development) In general, requests made from fronted are answered and the model of the database built in MongoDB is described.

## Getting Started

If you want to run the application in an emulator you must have npm installed and run the following commands

- npm install
- npm start

If you want to generate the apk of the application run this command

- expo build:android -t apk

## Built With

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) - The Frontend Language.
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The Backend Language.
- [ExpressJs](https://expressjs.com/) - Web application framework for Node.

## Future

There are plenty of features that we would love to implement into RappiProsperity

- One of them is the integration with Payu to make payments as an investor and RappiTenderos, as well as withdrawals and disbursement of credits.
- Develop the donation option, including the functionality of "see my donations"
- Deployment of the application on a server.
- Add the functionality of requesting a loan for money whose amount is less than 1,000,000
